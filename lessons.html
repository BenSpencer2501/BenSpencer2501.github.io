                    To begin the youth classes journey, we invite young people (5-17yrs) along with their guardians to a (free) Discovery Taster Session where youngsters* can try all forms of circus and we can assess which stage they are at, in order to enrol them in the right course. <br>

                    Our Circus Skill workshops are structured workshops for schools and small community groups. Workshops are led by two professional circus practitioners and each workshop can take up to 30 young people at once. <br>

                    We teach a variety of skills including juggling, plate spinning, diabolo, poi, hula hooping, balance skills, pedal go's. Everyone will have their own piece of kit and we play games, learn skills and most of all we build confidence.
